                                        <p>The one major problem caused during this pandemic is the unavailability of test kits. More tests, epidemiologists say, would give us a better understanding of how the virus is going to move through the population

                                            and whether it's waxing or waning. More testing is essential to allow us to safely return to a semblance of normal life. Using an algorithm sounds like a preferable solution to this problem. Computer scientists and engineers who study ways to compress data, decode videos and process medical images say that biological samples from a group of people can be pooled for testing and results can be decoded by cleverly designed algorithms. This sample pooling could go a long way towards addressing the test kit shortage, with one kit being able to determine the health status of 5, 10, or even more people.In a pooled test you are taking biological material from multiple people and testing it once. This works best in a situation in which the majority of the people don't have the disease. We are going to want to test a huge number of people for the coronavirus—like anybody who gets on a plane, maybe even anybody who gets into a major government building. If testing was available at a reasonable cost, Amazon, for example, could test its warehouse employees every day. To truly restart the economy, we need to test not tens or hundreds of thousands a day but millions a day. An algorithm that passes messages containing statistical information between the patient nodes and the test nodes—revealing the probability that I, as a patient, am sick based on the information gathered so far can be a great idea economically and can be time-saving.

                                            Oil spills can have disastrous consequences for society; economically, environmentally, and socially. We need to have better tech for oil spills clean-up to decrease these damages. Tests conducted that can greatly accelerate the combustion of crude oil floating on water demonstrated its potential to become an effective tool for minimizing the environmental impact of future oil spills called the Flame Refluxer, the technology, developed by WPI, could make it possible to burn off spilt oil quickly while producing relatively low levels of air pollutants. In-situ burning is already a very successful process, but to improve the air quality more effectively we need a new method. A new technique is developed in which a Flame Refluxer which consists of metal coils attached to a blanket made from copper wool sandwiched between two layers of copper mesh. The blanket is designed to be placed on top of floating oil that has been collected with a boom towed by boats. After the oil is ignited, the coils and blanket transmit heat from the flames to superheat the oil, which increases its burning rate and efficiency. As a result, oil burns more completely. The more complete combustion produces fewer airborne emissions, and any solid residue is captured by the copper wool and kept out of the water column.

This pulse deforms the glass at its focal point, forming a tiny 3D structure called a voxel.<br>This experimental form of optical data storage, nicknamed as "Project Silica" was initiated by researchers at the University of Southampton, England, with the collaboration of Microsoft Research.  <br>It has completed its first proof of concept by writing the 1978 film Superman on a single small piece of glass and was able to retrieve it. Microsoft can currently write hundreds of layers of voxels into each piece of glass. The glass can be written to once and read back many times. This is data in the glass, not on the glass.Reading data from the glass requires an extremely different setup, which is one drawback of this method. <br>Microsoft isn't alone, several researchers are focused on understanding the potential of optical data storage in a glass. <br>The Microsoft team is also considering what it means to store data for  prolonged periods.

                                            Falcon 9 being the world’s first orbital class reusable rocket allows SpaceX to refly the most expensive parts of the rocket, which in turn drives down the cost of space access. Falcon 9’s first stage incorporates nine Merlin engine and aluminium-lithium alloy tans containing liquid oxygen and roket – grade kerosene (RP-1) propellant. Falcon 9 generates more than 1.7 million pounds of thrust at sea level.The second stage, powered by a single merlin vaccum engine , delivers Falcon 9’s payload to the desired orbit . The second stage engine ignites a few seconds after stage separation and can be restarted multiple time to place multiple payloads into different orbits.The key innovation to the aerospace industry that SpaceX made was the programming of self-landing boosters. The Falcon 9 booster has the ability to land itself autonomously which allows for rapid reusability.This causes the price of launching a payload to be incredibly lower than other competitors who have to build a new rocket for every launch.

                                                Another company, D-Wave, has focused on building quantum annealers rather than a universal quantum computer and with the current pandemic prevailing worldwide and researchers trying to find the treatment and vaccine for the Corona Virus, quantum computing seems to be a shot worth trying. In contrast to classical computing, which deals in the definitive ones and zeros of binary data processing, quantum computing takes advantage of molecular-scale property to process data as indefinite combinations of ones and zeroes as quantum bits, or qubits. Quantum annealing can be used for a more limited subset of problems, but this approach also helped D-Wave be one of the first manufacturers to market. Burnaby, B.C.-based D-Wave Systems says it’s providing free access to its Leap hybrid quantum cloud service to anyone who has ideas for how to use them to find a cure for COVID-19. D-Wave and a number of its customers, including Cineca, Denso, Forschungszentrum Jülich, Kyocera, MDR, Menten AI, NEC, OTI Lumionics, QAR Lab at LMU Munich, Sigma-i, Tohoku University, and Volkswagen, are all collectively offering assistance via engineering team access, advice on how to formulate problems for a D-Wave system, and solutions development.A recent post on DWaveSys states that “We are making available free Leap resources to help fight COVID-19. This includes time on our quantum processing units (QPUs) and hybrid solvers, as well as access to a wealth of other resources to help you get started, including our online integrated development environment (IDE), community discussion forums, learning materials, and more.” While D-Wave’s quantum consortium is only one of the groupings using advanced computing technologies to address the Corona Virus crisis, leaders in the field of high-performance computing including Amazon and Microsoft announced that they would joining forces to facilitate access to supercomputers and cloud computing services for Corona Virus research.

                                            Quantum computers are very expensive, highly complex machines that are nothing like one’s regular, friendly laptop. It works with particles that can be in superposition. Rather than representing bits — such particles would represent qubits, which can take on the value 0 or 1, or both simultaneously. Quantum computing is based on the fact that, in the microscopic world, things don't have to be as clear-cut as we'd expect from our macroscopic experience. Tiny particles, such as electrons or photons, can simultaneously take on states that we would normally deem mutually exclusive. They can be in several places at once, for example, and in the case of photons simultaneously exhibit two kinds of polarization. We never see this superposition of different states in ordinary life because it somehow disappears once a system is observed: when you measure the location of an electron or the polarization of a photon, all but one of the possible alternatives are eliminated and you will see just one.
                                            
                                            Every day, we produce 2.5 Exabytes of data. That number is equivalent to the content on 5 million laptops. The race is on to build the world’s first meaningful quantum computer—one that can deliver the technology’s long-promised ability to help scientists do things like develop miraculous new materials, encrypt data with near-perfect security and accurately predict how Earth’s climate will change. Such a machine is likely more than a decade away, but IBM, Microsoft, Google, Intel, and other tech heavyweights breathlessly tout each tiny, incremental step along the way. Most of these milestones involve packing ever more quantum bits, or qubits—the basic unit of information in a quantum computer—onto a processor chip.

                                                Given the similarities between the lungs of affected patients and presence of visual hallmarks as observed by the teams in China and USA, chest scans have undergone major studying.AI-powered analysis of chest scans holds the potential to alleviate the growing burden on radiologists by reviewing and predicting which patients are most likely to need a ventilator and medications and which can be sent home. Chinese technology giant Alibaba Group revealed an AI algorithm with an accuracy of 96%. Being used in 26 hospitals in China, it has already helped diagnose more than 30,000 cases. This algorithm is also capable of detecting the signs of improvement in patients. Another Seoul based company created an AI-powered software , which is being used to assist screening and has also been installed in one of the largest hospital networks in Brazil to screen patients.Cloud networks and free of cost AI powered, online X-ray analysis have also emerged in some countries. To help fight COVID -19, companies in Hong Kong, Seoul and China are trying to compile multiple datasets and develop a neural network, compiling large open data repositories of images and associated data from hospitals and societies around the world

                                            Mo Elshenawy said “At the social level, self-driving cars have the potential to save millions of lives, reshape our cities, reduce harmful emissions, give back billions of hours of time and restore freedom of movement”. He also mentioned that these carswill be safer, more convenient, affordable and accessible.At the launch event of Cruise, a major GE subsidiary, they unveiled a fully autonomous *SUV Cruise Origin* , a completely app-controlled urban transportation. The designers of the ride sharing vehicle made all the sensors and computer systems modular for easy replacement and upgrading. Removing driver related tools such as the steering wheel, side view mirror ,etc., not only reduced the cost but also provided space for bigger passenger room. The company stated that the manufacture of this car costed them far less than what was expected and also estimated that an average urban dweller who relies on Cruise Origin for transportation will save USD 5000, per year from personal transportation.In a world where pollution has become a major concern, an electric car that acts as a taxi to transport people but also cut downs the transportation expenditure, not only helps the people but also the environment as carbon emissions would be substantially less, the pollution level would decrease and invaluable resources like crude oil would be used much more conservatively..

                                            The first autonomous robot was created in 1948 by William Grey Walter. The robot could find its way around obstacles without human help by following light and making use of a bump sensor.Autonomous robots can vary significantly in size, functionality, mobility, artificial intelligence, and cost. “Vyommitra” -a half humanoid robotic astronaut by ISRO, Roomba- vacuum cleaner and drones are some examples of autonomous robots. With advancements in artificial intelligence, autonomous robots are increasingly programmed to recognize and learn from their surroundings and make decisions independently.When used in material handling, autonomous robots can help reduce errors, increase efficiency and productivity, extremely reliable, improve safety for employes in high risk work environments.

                                        <p>The Israel-based startup, Eviation was at the centre of the next big step forward in electric aviation when the Massachusetts-based airline CapeAir announced it had placed the world’s first order for commercial all-electric passenger airplane.

                                            The Alice, a three-engine, battery-powered airplane that can fly up to 1,000 kilometres on a single charge, will be delivered to Cape Air in 2022. The Alice will be powered by a 900-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery manufactured by the South Korean company Kokam Battery.Electric propulsion holds major advantages in all aspects of flight. Eviation CEO Omar Bar-Ohay showcased the Alice at the Paris Air Show in June and spoke about the differences inherent indesigning an all-electric airplane and a conventional, petroleum fuelled plane. For example, no fuel is burned during flight, so the plane’s take-off weight (6,350 kilograms or 14,000 pounds) is more or less the same as its landing weight (and the battery accounts for 3,700 kg). Because the Alice relies only on electric charge, the cost of operating the plane is expected to be lower than for its petroleum-fuelledcounterparts. And the noise emitted by a plane with no internal combustion engines is also lower and this is especially true for the Alice, given its ability (unique to e-aircraft) to vary its propeller speeds to compensate for crosswinds and to lower cabin noise. Alice also leads the way in safety and efficiency, all three motors are designed to have double or triple redundancy in their components.The batteries onboard are designed in a way that any malfunction or failure will result in minimal reduction in the capacity, if any.Now regarding the U.S. Airline, Cape Air that has taken the smart yet bold decision to make an order for electric planes:Cape Air is best suited to start with electric planes as they fly to popular vacation destinations and cover short distances.The company’s headquarters are 100 percent solar powered and the company hopes to use sustainable energy sources to charge its fleet of e-airplanes

                                        <p>Have you ever wondered how today’s heavy, silicon based sensors will look like in future? Many researchers are already working to find cheaper alternatives for them.

                                            Imagine how great will it for users if they went to a shop to buy packed food item and could know the quality of that item by just waving their smartphones over it. An app installed in their phone would communicate with the sensor embedded in the packet and tell the user the real time quality of the food item . This can only be made possible if the sensor used in it was cheap. But the question arises as to how can we made today’s sensor so cheap that it could be made available to consumer of every class.Today’s IOT sensors are based on MEMS (microelectromechanical systems). This essentially means that the sensors are fabricated on silicon wafers, which is the major cost affecting factor. So if we want to develop cheap sensors, then we have to look at cheaper materials, like paper and plastic. Every sensor needs some power to operate and the problem is to provide that power to a smaller sensor keeping manufacturing cost minimum. And the answer to this lies in the utilization of Near Field Communication, which is used for contactless electronic pay.The major limitation for this technology is the difficulty in its implementation for complex sensors. For simple sensors like infrared, ultrasonic type sensors, we can easily convert them onto plastic and paper but in the case of complex sensors like gyroscopic sensors, it is difficult to convert them in the early stages of this technology.Today most manufacturers compete to make good products at cheaper prices and this type of technology could help them to achieve this and provide their customers with latest and ecofriendly technology.

                                            After a technical glitch that led to postponing the launch by a week, it was successfully launched from Satish Dhavan Space Centre on 22nd July 2019 at 2:43 P.M.The prime focus for this mission is demonstrate soft landing on the lunar surface along with operating a robotic rover over the surface. The attempt is to soft land the lander and rover in a high plain between two craters, Manzinus C and Simpelius N, at a latitude of about 70° south. Alongside it will accomplish scientific goals such as mapping the topography, study the mineralogy, exosphere and abundance of lunar water and elements.Chandrayan 2 has three major constituents, namely lunar orbiter, lander Vikram, and lunar rover Pragyan. According to the research, the operational strategy is that the wheeled Pragyan rover will move on the lunar surface and will perform on-site chemical analysis for a period of 14 days (one lunar day). The Data will be relayed to Earth through the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter and lander, which were launched together on the same rocket. The orbiter will perform its mission for one year.The complete development of Chandrayan 2 was accomplished by Indians. The scientists and engineers who were instrumental to the development of this project wereMuthayya Vanitha – Project Director,Ritu Karidhal – Mission Director,Chandrakanta Kumar – Deputy Project Director.Through this effort, the aim is to improve our understanding of the lunar surface and find discoveries that could prove to be instrumental in future missions. If successful, India would be the fourth country to soft land on the lunar surface and Chandrayaan 2 would be the southernmost lunar landing in the history so far.

                                            It employs the realisation of qubits to improve the scopeof computation. But not everyone believes that quantum computing is going to be a feasible possibility in the near future. Many researchers involved in the fieldacknowledge the hype has gotten out of control, cautioning that quantum computing may take decades to mature; still a couple of tech giants are pouring huge amounts of money into building prototypes.Even Mikhail Dyakonov(Theoretical physicist, University of Montpellier), has conveyedthat the practical general-purpose quantum computers will not be built anytime in the foreseeable future. On the other hand experts at Google, University of California, University of Chicago took up the challenge to estimate the time and resources required, and to assess the probability of success of creating a functional quantum computer capable of addressing real-world problems. And they concluded that it is highly unexpected that anyone will be able to build a quantum computer in upcoming future. Although, people working in the area are nevertheless thrilled by recent progress they’ve made but, are reticent to make concrete predictions, and hence, the answer to our question remains “Nobody really knows."

                                            MAGNETIC TAPES is a data storage system for storing digital information on magnetic tape using digital recording.•Much of the world's data such as particle physics, radio astronomy, banking, explorations and much more is stored on tape.•First commercial digital tape storage system was developed by IBM, names Model 726 . It could store just 1.1 MB of data.•Advancement in technologies such as magnetic materials have enabled MAGNETIC TAPES to store 15 TB of data.Why Magnetic Tapes ?•SECURE , built in on the fly encryption.•CHEAPER, when compared to conventional hard disks drives(HDD).•EXTENSIVELY RELIABLE , low error rates of the order four or five magnitude than that of HDD.•ENERGY EFFICIENT , after the storage of data, they are kept in offline mode in a robotic library unlike HDD.How magnetic tapes saved the day ?•In 2011, due to a flaw in a software update saved emails of 40,000 google users were deleted. The loss occurred despite there being several copies of the data across multiple data centres. Fortunately, the data was also recorded on tape, which helped Google to restore data.

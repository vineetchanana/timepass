The guidance required to navigate precisely to the spots where robotic spacecraft pointed to the ice on the lunar map.On Earth, GPS was capable of pinpointing locations with accuracy measured in centimetres but, the question was, could it help astronauts on lunar voyages? Kar-Ming Cheung and Charles Lee of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California worked on it and confirmed its Possibility IEEE Aerospace Conference, Montana proposed the idea of testing whether signals from existing global navigation satellites near the Earth can be used to guide astronauts in lunar orbit, who are 385,000 km away. The signals from Europe’s Galileo and Russia’s GLONASS system were strong enough to be read by spacecraft with compact receivers near the moon. The calculation was that a spacecraft in lunar orbit would be able to see between five and 13 satellites’ signals at any given time—enough to accurately determine its position in space to within 200 to 300 meters. Navigation after landing on the moon’s surface is more complicated as signals are easily blocked by hills or crater rims. The idea of using two satellites in lunar orbit was proposed by the scientists.NASA managers had been banking a planned lunar-orbiting base station, known as the Gateway, but it may have to wait until later in the decade. Despite these failed attempts and problems, Cheung’s optimism did not fail.",

//     "When you think about Bluetooth, you probably think about things like wireless headphones, computer mice, and other personal devices that utilize short-range, low-power technology & unsecured connections. It turns out that Bluetooth can go much farther than a couple of meters without much power consumption. Apptricity, a USA based company that provides asset- and inventory-tracking technologies, has developed a Bluetooth beacon that can transmit signals over 32 Km(20 miles). Apptricity’s customer companies can use satellite or LTE tags to keep track of stuff. While such tags don’t require a person to actively track items, they are far more expensive, requiring a costly subscription to either a satellite or LTE network.So, the burning question is how do you send a Bluetooth signal over 30-plus km? The key new wrinkle, according to Apptricity’s CEO, Tim Garcia, is the precise tuning within the Bluetooth spectrum. Garcia says it’s the same principle as a tightly focused laser beam. A laser beam will travel farther without its signal weakening beyond recovery if the photons making up the beam are all as close to a specific frequency as possible. Thus, the beacons can send and receive data without interfering with other wireless signals and without requiring unwieldy amounts of power. By its own estimation, Apptricity’s Bluetooth beacons are 90 percent cheaper than LTE or satellite tags, specifically because Bluetooth devices don’t require paying for a subscription to an established network.The company’s current transmission distance record for its Bluetooth beacons is 38 km (23.6 miles)The company has also demonstrated non-commercial versions of the beacons for the USDD with broadcast ranges between 80 and 120 km. So, what do you think about this tech? Can it find its place in commercial markets of mobiles, IoT & various other communication devices? ",

In its launch video, Stretch was seen cleaning a counter top using vacuum and even doing some laundry.However, Stretch required a demonstrator to control it. Hello Robot claims that its autonomous properties will improve in future. About the price, Hello Robot is currently selling it at $17,950. Having offices in San Francisco Bay Area and Atlanta, Hello Robot was founded by former Google robotics director Aaron Edsinger and Georgia Tech professor Charlie Kemp. Without capital funding, Hello Robot will initially offer Stretch as a research platform, which can be made for commercial use for homes and offices in future.One of the key features of Stretch is its telescoping arm, which extends up to half a meter and can lift a weight of around 1.5 kg. The robot itself weighs only 23kg, a tenth of PR2’s.For Kemp, Hello Robot’s chief technical officer, Stretch is an attempt to get everything he’s been teaching his robots at Georgia Tech’s Healthcare Robotics Lab out into the world where it can actually be helpful to people.",

Robots perform these chores tirelessly, allowing staff to interact more with patients. Hospitals have found a wide variety of applications for automatons ranging for reminding people to wear face masks and wash hands to checking their temperatures using thermal cameras. Telepresence robots fitted with cameras and microphones are utilised to check on patents remotely, reducing the risk that workers contract the virus.

The streets of dozens of cities have seen the proliferation of hurrying wheeled machines. Delivery robots are in high demand as online orders continue to skyrocket. These robots navigate using cameras, GPS and radar. Robot makers say that the experience that they've gained during this trial-by-fire deployment will make future machines smarter and more capable.

Human drivers don’t think twice about whether to follow the gesture or the sign; they move smoothly forward without stopping. This situation, however, would likely stop an autonomous vehicle in its tracks. It would understand the stop sign and how to react, but that hand gesture? That’s a lot more complicated.Now, to all the gestures that people make on the roads, these are some signals to which humans react without much thought but it’s quite a challenge for a computer system that’s still learning about the world around it.So, CRUISE found a creative solution to the data gap: motion capture (or mo-cap) of human gestures. They have been hiring game developers for expertise in simulating a detailed world. So, the team at CRUISE came up with a list of five key gestures; stop, go, turn left, turn right, and “no” using motion capture technology.CRUISE selected a non-optical, sensor-based version of motion capture instead. This technology, which relies on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), is portable and wireless. They included volunteers of different body types, height, weight and gender. They made different gestures at various intensities and ended up with 239 thirty-second clips of it. The data was prepared by the engineers to be fed into machine learning models. Well, training their SELF-DRIVING cars to understand gestures is only the beginning. These systems must be able to detect more than just the basic movements of a person. They’re planning to expand their data set to help their cars understand other things too.Self-driving cars are really going to transform our lives majorly in the years to come. The creative use of technology does wonders and this development will prove out to be a reason for quicker and safer roads for all.",

More testing is essential to allow us to safely return to a semblance of normal life.Using an algorithm sounds like a preferable solution to this problem. Computer scientists and engineers who study ways to compress data, decode videos and process medical images say that biological samples from a group of people can be pooled for testing and results can be decoded by cleverly designed algorithms. This sample pooling could go a long way towards addressing the test kit shortage, with one kit being able to determine the health status of 5, 10, or even more people.In a pooled test you are taking biological material from multiple people and testing it once.

The blanket is designed to be placed on top of floating oil that has been collected with a boom towed by boats. After the oil is ignited, the coils and blanket transmit heat from the flames to superheat the oil, which increases its burning rate and efficiency. As a result, oil burns more completely.

//     "How long will it be before we see practical quantum computing machines?Quantum Computing is an exciting field emerged from the intersection of mathematics computer science and physics. It employs the realisation of qubits to improve the scopeof computation. But not everyone believes that quantum computing is going to be a feasible possibility in the near future. Many researchers involved in the fieldacknowledge the hype has gotten out of control, cautioning that quantum computing may take decades to mature; still a couple of tech giants are pouring huge amounts of money into building prototypes.Even Mikhail Dyakonov(Theoretical physicist, University of Montpellier), has conveyedthat the practical general-purpose quantum computers will not be built anytime in the foreseeable future. On the other hand experts at Google, University of California, University of Chicago took up the challenge to estimate the time and resources required, and to assess the probability of success of creating a functional quantum computer capable of addressing real-world problems. And they concluded that it is highly unexpected that anyone will be able to build a quantum computer in upcoming future. Although, people working in the area are nevertheless thrilled by recent progress they’ve made but, are reticent to make concrete predictions, and hence, the answer to our question remains “Nobody really knows”.",

//     "•Amount of data being stored in increasing at the rate of 30 to 40 percent per year.Since,most of the information stored does not need to be accessed instantly , MAGNETIC TAPES are a perfect solution .•MAGNETIC TAPES is a data storage system for storing digital information on magnetic tape using digital recording.•Much of the world's data such as particle physics, radio astronomy, banking, explorations and much more is stored on tape.•First commercial digital tape storage system was developed by IBM, names Model 726 . It could store just 1.1 MB of data.•Advancement in technologies such as magnetic materials have enabled MAGNETIC TAPES to store 15 TB of data.Why Magnetic Tapes ?•SECURE , built in on the fly encryption.•CHEAPER, when compared to conventional hard disks drives(HDD).•EXTENSIVELY RELIABLE , low error rates of the order four or five magnitude than that of HDD.•ENERGY EFFICIENT , after the storage of data, they are kept in offline mode in a robotic library unlike HDD.How magnetic tapes saved the day ?•In 2011, due to a flaw in a software update saved emails of 40,000 google users were deleted. The loss occurred despite there being several copies of the data across multiple data centres. Fortunately, the data was also recorded on tape, which helped Google to restore data.",

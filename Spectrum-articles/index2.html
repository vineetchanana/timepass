                                        <p>Lately, the main objective of the astronauts of NASA was to mine deposits of ice in craters near the lunar south pole which could break down into hydrogen and oxygen.

                                            The guidance required to navigate precisely to the spots where robotic spacecraft pointed to the ice on the lunar map.On Earth, GPS was capable of pinpointing locations with accuracy measured in centimetres but, the question was, could it help astronauts on lunar voyages? Kar-Ming Cheung and Charles Lee of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California worked on it and confirmed its Possibility IEEE Aerospace Conference, Montana proposed the idea of testing whether signals from existing global navigation satellites near the Earth can be used to guide astronauts in lunar orbit, who are 385,000 km away. The signals from Europe’s Galileo and Russia’s GLONASS system were strong enough to be read by spacecraft with compact receivers near the moon. The calculation was that a spacecraft in lunar orbit would be able to see between five and 13 satellites’ signals at any given time—enough to accurately determine its position in space to within 200 to 300 meters. Navigation after landing on the moon’s surface is more complicated as signals are easily blocked by hills or crater rims. The idea of using two satellites in lunar orbit was proposed by the scientists.NASA managers had been banking a planned lunar-orbiting base station, known as the Gateway, but it may have to wait until later in the decade. Despite these failed attempts and problems, Cheung’s optimism did not fail.

                                        <h4><a href="article29.html" title="">Sending Bluetooth Signals over 20 miles</a></h4>
                                        <p>When you think about Bluetooth, you probably think about things like wireless headphones, computer mice, and other personal devices that utilize short-range, low-power technology & unsecured connections.
                                            <span id="dots29">...</span><span id="more29">
                                                It turns out that Bluetooth can go much farther than a couple of meters without much power consumption. Apptricity, a USA based company that provides asset- and inventory-tracking technologies, has developed a Bluetooth beacon that can transmit signals over 32 Km(20 miles). Apptricity’s customer companies can use satellite or LTE tags to keep track of stuff. While such tags don’t require a person to actively track items, they are far more expensive, requiring a costly subscription to either a satellite or LTE network.So, the burning question is how do you send a Bluetooth signal over 30-plus km? The key new wrinkle, according to Apptricity’s CEO, Tim Garcia, is the precise tuning within the Bluetooth spectrum. Garcia says it’s the same principle as a tightly focused laser beam. A laser beam will travel farther without its signal weakening beyond recovery if the photons making up the beam are all as close to a specific frequency as possible. Thus, the beacons can send and receive data without interfering with other wireless signals and without requiring unwieldy amounts of power. By its own estimation, Apptricity’s Bluetooth beacons are 90 percent cheaper than LTE or satellite tags, specifically because Bluetooth devices don’t require paying for a subscription to an established network.The company’s current transmission distance record for its Bluetooth beacons is 38 km (23.6 miles)The company has also demonstrated non-commercial versions of the beacons for the USDD with broadcast ranges between 80 and 120 km. So, what do you think about this tech? Can it find its place in commercial markets of mobiles, IoT & various other communication devices?

                                        <h4><a href="article28.html" title="">A robot that keeps it simple</a></h4>
                                        <p>Almost a decade ago, a Silicon Valley startup( now defunct) created a masterpiece, Personal Robot or PR2. PR2 became a success because of its versatility and ease of configuration.
                                        <span id="dots28">...</span><span id="more28">
                                            With this, researchers could focus on research rather than building a new system from scratch. But PR2 lacked in a few areas such as having a size of a human made it big, heavy and expensive($400,000).Now, another startup, Hello Robot came up with a new mindset for their upcoming project. They just announced their robot, Stretch this past July - A tall, slender robot that comes with a telescopic arm. Due to it's design, Stretch is lightweight and affordable. In its launch video, Stretch was seen cleaning a counter top using vacuum and even doing some laundry.However, Stretch required a demonstrator to control it. Hello Robot claims that its autonomous properties will improve in future. About the price, Hello Robot is currently selling it at $17,950. Having offices in San Francisco Bay Area and Atlanta, Hello Robot was founded by former Google robotics director Aaron Edsinger and Georgia Tech professor Charlie Kemp. Without capital funding, Hello Robot will initially offer Stretch as a research platform, which can be made for commercial use for homes and offices in future.One of the key features of Stretch is its telescoping arm, which extends up to half a meter and can lift a weight of around 1.5 kg. The robot itself weighs only 23kg, a tenth of PR2’s.For Kemp, Hello Robot’s chief technical officer, Stretch is an attempt to get everything he’s been teaching his robots at Georgia Tech’s Healthcare Robotics Lab out into the world where it can actually be helpful to people.

                                        <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, robots have turned out to be one of the most valuable assets in medical facilities. Robots don't need masks, can be easily disinfected and, of course, they don't get sick.
                                        <span id="dots27">...</span><span id="more27">
                                            An ideal role for robots is taking over repetitive chores such as fetching supplies and disinfecting rooms using UV-C lights which destroy the genetic material of viruses. Robots perform these chores tirelessly, allowing staff to interact more with patients. Hospitals have found a wide variety of applications for automatons ranging for reminding people to wear face masks and wash hands to checking their temperatures using thermal cameras. Telepresence robots fitted with cameras and microphones are utilised to check on patents remotely, reducing the risk that workers contract the virus. To speed up COVID testing, a team of Danish doctors and engineers is developing a fully automated swab robot using machine learning to perform swab tests with swiftness and accuracy that humans can't match. Authorities in several countries are using drones to make deliveries of essential goods. The expectations that soon we will have drones transporting critical materials such as test samples, drugs and vaccines. The streets of dozens of cities have seen the proliferation of hurrying wheeled machines. Delivery robots are in high demand as online orders continue to skyrocket. These robots navigate using cameras, GPS and radar. Robot makers say that the experience that they've gained during this trial-by-fire deployment will make future machines smarter and more capable. Robots can't replace human interaction, but they can help people feel more connected at a time when meetings and other social activities are on hold.

                                        <p>One reason that the PC has endured nearly 40 years is because of an open design. This openness seeded an explosion of PC compatibles. Among the most complex chips of it's day, the 8087 accelerated mathematical computations.

                                            For early users of AutoCAD, popping that chip into your PC and rendering detailed computer-aided-design (CAD) drawings no longer felt excruciatingly slow. The PCs these days are a million times faster and cost a third accounting for inflation in 2020. The new co-processors from the likes of Nvidia perform the computations at 200 million times the speed of their ancestors. The computing hardware we quickly grew to depend on has now shrunk to a smartphone, representing essential parts of a PC, trimmed to accommodate a modest size and budget. The smartphones are even better networked than early PCS were. The real co-processor is the connected capacity of some 4 billion other smartphone-carrying people, each capable of sharing with and learning from one another through the Web or on various social-media platforms.We all now have powerful tools at our fingertips for connecting with others. When we plug ourselves into this global coprocessor, we can put our heads together to imagine, plan and produce or to conspire, harass and thwart. We can search and destroy, or we can create and share. With the great power of technology, comes a great responsibility.

                                        <p>Nowadays, it could be seen on the city street corners that one worker holds a stop sign loosely in his left hand as he waves cars through with his right.

                                            Human drivers don’t think twice about whether to follow the gesture or the sign; they move smoothly forward without stopping. This situation, however, would likely stop an autonomous vehicle in its tracks. It would understand the stop sign and how to react, but that hand gesture? That’s a lot more complicated.Now, to all the gestures that people make on the roads, these are some signals to which humans react without much thought but it’s quite a challenge for a computer system that’s still learning about the world around it.So, CRUISE found a creative solution to the data gap: motion capture (or mo-cap) of human gestures. They have been hiring game developers for expertise in simulating a detailed world. So, the team at CRUISE came up with a list of five key gestures; stop, go, turn left, turn right, and “no” using motion capture technology.CRUISE selected a non-optical, sensor-based version of motion capture instead. This technology, which relies on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), is portable and wireless. They included volunteers of different body types, height, weight and gender. They made different gestures at various intensities and ended up with 239 thirty-second clips of it. The data was prepared by the engineers to be fed into machine learning models. Well, training their SELF-DRIVING cars to understand gestures is only the beginning. These systems must be able to detect more than just the basic movements of a person. They’re planning to expand their data set to help their cars understand other things too.Self-driving cars are really going to transform our lives majorly in the years to come. The creative use of technology does wonders and this development will prove out to be a reason for quicker and safer roads for all.

                                        <h4><a href="article24.html" title="">Remote Teaching</a></h4>
                                        <p>Amidst the COVID- 19 induced lockdown, every sector has faced a number of challenges, with the educational sector being no different. Institutions had to migrate to the online education model almost overnight.
                                        <!-- <small class="firstsmall"><a class="bg-orange" href="#" title="">Technology</a></small> -->

                                            This shift of medium came with its own merits which included better assessment by online quizzes and understanding of difficult topics via visual means.On the flip side, it came with its own set of challenges like lack of IT infrastructure, inability of stakeholders to adapt to the new online systems, not to mention complaints of screen fatigue because of long sessions.Sudhaman Parthasarathy, Head of the Department of Computer Applications at the Thiagarajar College of Engineering, suggests some practices for educational institutions to follow to combat these caveats. Institutes should stick with the software the faculty and students are familiar with. Rushing towards new and complex softwares, without giving proper training can be confusing.The schools should consider the “flipped classroom” model for the students facing issues with the online platform. Training the faculty and students on how to deal with bugs and use the platform, should be done at regular intervals.The e- platform provides a flexible and accessible medium, which also has potential to attract more students across the globe.Parthasarathy further added that the administration should understand these benefits and should not be hesitant on adding expenditure for IT resources for a reliable online educational platform.

Foresters can also use this data to develop management plans and project what the forest will look like in the future. Apart from that, predicting fires and suitability of the habitat will be some important features. The company is catering to individual landowners, conservation groups and hunters.
